# SleepTracker

This project serves as a straightforward sleep tracker. Utilizing Angular with Angular Material for the front-end and a .NET Web API for back-end functionality, it displays and manages sleep records. I built this project primarily to solidify my understanding of Angular fundamentals and Angular Material.    
The interface allows users to sort table data based on date, fall asleep time, wake up time, or duration. Additionally, users can perform essential CRUD operations.    
The .NET Web API used in this project: [Sleep Tracker API](https://github.com/ionutng/SleepTrackerApi)
